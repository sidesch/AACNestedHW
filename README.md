Mini Project 5: AAC Devices
=============================

Sarah Deschamps and Catie Baker

A project for CSC-207 2024Fa.

This project uses AAC Categories and AAC Mappings to create an interface that may be helpful for users. When an image is clicked, the interface reads the name of the image. 

References: Maria Rodriguez for helping me understand the high level of AACMappings.
